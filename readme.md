## [EN] Software description
-Solve the problem that the screen size becomes smaller when the Mi Pro notebook wakes up after hibernation after turning on hiDPI
-Solve the problem that the sound card is silent after the Xiaomi pro notebook sleeps and wakes up (the reason for it is not clear, but the test is effective!)

## Version features
-It only supports the 15-inch screen of the Mi Pro notebook <displayId=2034356672>, it is not clear whether the Mi 13 storage screen is a device with the same ID
-Only when HiDPI is 1440x810 or 1600x900, automatically set hiDPI after wake-up from sleep, and do nothing with other resolutions
-Lower sleep time than the previous RDM-Z version, theoretically the experience will be better
